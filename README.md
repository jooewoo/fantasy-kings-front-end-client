## Development Process/Problem Solving Strategy
### Back End API
My initial approach was to set up my individual resources in my Back End, and to work on the styling of the board last. I made a basic HTML page so I could see my results, and made sure all the interactions were displaying correctly. Then, I wanted to style it the way I wanted to display more of my own personality. Finally, I progressed into the stretch goals that were assigned.

First, I began my process with the User Authentication API interactions. I used the curl scripts for sign up, sign in, change password, and sign out in order to make sure my connection with the API was working correctly. Then, I proceeded to set up my events, api, and ui js files and check that I was correctly processing the information from the API.

Afterwards, I moved onto the game API and game logic. I made new events, api, and ui js files to receive the data from the API. Eventually, I processed that information so that I use it for the game logic, which included the following.
  - Winning conditions
  - Switching players after a move was processed
  - Preventing the user from clicking on an occupied space

Once I finished both the User and Game Authentication, and game logic, I styled my website to suit my own favorite sport. I made it into an NFL theme, where you battle it out with your favorite team against the league.

## Future Intentions
- Mininum Maximum Algorithm
- Basketball Themed Tic Tac Toe
- Scoreboard on top
- Multiplayer API
- Games from Multiple Devices
- NFL Theme
- Javascript Board
- ELO Rating
- Keep track of multiple game rounds
- Use local storage to persist data locally, allowing games to continue after page refresh or loss of internet connectivity

After revaluating my code, I noticed that there are easier and shorter ways of writing my code. I would like to use more ternary operators as much as I can. I would also like to work on the multiplayer API, and the ability to play games through multiple devices. Also, I want to make my tic tac toe game similar to the NFL website. Another challenege would be to get rid of the HTML board, and create the board from javascript alone. Overall, I am a perfectionist, and I want to push myself to beyond my capped potential.

## Wireframes/User Stories
